# Store API

I have developed a backend project called Store API that leverages MongoDB for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project is designed to handle various data management tasks for a store, ensuring efficient and effective data manipulation and retrieval using MongoDB as the database solution.

Key Features of the Store API Project:
Create Operations: The API allows for the addition of new records to the MongoDB database. This includes creating new products, customer records, orders, and other related data entities.

Read Operations: Users can retrieve data from the database with ease. The API provides endpoints to fetch single or multiple records, enabling detailed queries to obtain specific information or general data overviews.

Update Operations: The project supports updating existing records in the database. This feature is crucial for maintaining up-to-date information, allowing modifications to be made to existing products, customer details, and orders.

Delete Operations: The API includes functionality to delete records from the database. This ensures that obsolete or incorrect data can be removed, keeping the database clean and relevant.
